        Sizzling Sisig is a beloved Filipino dish known for its bold flavors and sizzling 
        <br>presentation. Traditionally made from finely chopped pork parts often including 
        <br>the cheeks, ears, and liver—it's seasoned with calamansi, onions, and chili, 
        <br>then served on a hot cast-iron plate that keeps it crackling at the table. With its 
        <br>savory, tangy, and slightly spicy taste, Sisig is a popular pulutan (beer match) 
        <br>and a must-try comfort food that showcases the creativity and resourcefulness of 
        <br>Filipino cuisine.
