        Pork Adobo is one of the most iconic and widely recognized dishes in 
        <br>Filipino cuisine. Known for its savory, tangy, and slightly sweet flavor, 
        <br>Pork Adobo is traditionally made by simmering pork in a mixture of soy 
        <br>sauce, vinegar, garlic, bay leaves, and black peppercorns. Its roots trace 
        <br>back to pre-colonial Philippines, where indigenous people preserved meat 
        <br>using vinegar and salt—a method later influenced by Spanish culinary 
        <br>techniques during colonization. Over time, adobo evolved into a national 
        <br>favorite with countless regional and family variations. Loved for its rich 
        <br>flavor and long shelf life, Pork Adobo is a symbol of home-style Filipino 
        <br>cooking and is often served with steamed rice for a truly satisfying meal.
